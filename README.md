# I'm Cameron White!

Currently I'm a Full Stack Web Developer student at Nashville Software School.

I'm learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript at the moment, but soon I'll be trying my hand at React and Python/Django!

I also have some interest in Web Application Security and Penetration Testing techniques.
